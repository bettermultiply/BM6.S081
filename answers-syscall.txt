usertrap() called syscall

We can easily find out that p->trapframe->a7 is 0x7 by typing p /x *p->trapframe
or look the user/initcode.S and find "li a7, SYS_exec" and find SYS_exec is 0x7 in proc.h

when use p /x $sstatus, it forms 0x200000022 and the eighth bit is 0 which indicates that now is in user mode.

register a3 corresponds to the varialable num
it is panic at 0x00000000800215a

the kernel crash for we are leaning an illeagle adress.
No, the address 0 didn't mapped in the kernel address space
the scause code is 13 which means "Load Page Fault" so it exactly proves it.

is initcode whose pid is 1
